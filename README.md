My Cards

Programmable Virtual Crypto Cards

The platform is introducing a better way to interact with crypto. THe current accounts are used for only 3 purposes 
1. Send funds
2. receive funds
3. Sign
They also store crypto in a scattered way, they are monolithic on account for all purpose risking the assets, no way to make them work according to you.

My Cards platfrom is providing a way where users can create cards (accounts) which are created with predeifend rules and instructions and permissions, that deceide how they behave and interacte. Rules range from setting the maximum balance, fixed amount of tokens per transaction, fixed number of transactions per day, subscriptions and more. Create asy many cards as you want just for 0.1 APT each. and store your assets in the card transfer from them, withdraw id needed. The platforms also provide analytics of all the things to make you take better decisions. On top of it our cards can be added to google wallet and then used to transact crypto by typing the device at terminals. THe next verison of system will have AI integrated to help users defien rules in natural languages or intent based.

How it works.
1. user connects wallet and create a card by defining the rules.
2. after the card is created the user add funds to it and use according to him and rules.
3. also there are features to withdraw, transfer and more.
4. can see all the cards in the dashboards for better access
5. copy the link from the card and add it in your google wallet and access card from it.
